## Why

Kami (紙, かみ) is the Japanese word for paper: the quiet surface on which a finished idea finally lands. Most document design drifts into two failure modes: generic corporate gray, or SaaS hype gradients. Neither reads like something a person actually made with care.

Kami holds one design idea across every format: warm parchment canvas, a single ink-blue accent, serif for authority, sans for utility, editorial whitespace tuned for print. 

Part of a trilogy: [Kaku](https://github.com/tw93/Kaku) (書く) writes code, [Waza](https://github.com/tw93/Waza) (技) drills habits, [Kami](https://github.com/tw93/Kami) (紙) ships documents. Think of them as a family: Kaku is the dad, Waza the big sister, Kami the little sister.

## Design

Warm parchment canvas, ink blue as the sole accent, serif carries authority, no hard shadows or flashy palettes. This is not a UI framework; it is an aesthetic constraint system for printed matter. Quality documents read like literature, not dashboards.

Six document types (One-Pager, Long Doc, Letter, Portfolio, Resume, Slides), each with Chinese and English variants. Three inline SVG diagram types (architecture, flowchart, quadrant) are included. Kami picks the right variant based on the language you write in.

| Element | Rule |
|---|---|
| Canvas | `#f5f4ed` parchment, never pure white |
| Accent | Ink blue `#1B365D` only, no second chromatic hue |
| Neutrals | All warm-toned (yellow-brown undertone), no cool blue-grays |
| Serif | Weight locked at 500, never bold. Single weight is the signature |
| Line-height | Tight titles 1.1-1.3, dense body 1.4-1.45, reading body 1.5-1.55. Never 1.6+ |
| Shadows | Ring or whisper only, no hard drop shadows |
| Tags | Solid hex backgrounds only. `rgba()` triggers a WeasyPrint double-rectangle bug |

**Fonts**: Chinese uses TsangerJinKai02 serif + Source Han Sans. TsangerJinKai is free for personal use, commercial use requires a license from [tsanger.cn](https://tsanger.cn). English uses Newsreader serif + Inter sans, both OFL open source.

## Background

I invest in US equities and regularly ask AI to generate analysis reports. The output always looked like a default Google Doc: bland, inconsistent, forgettable. I can't stand ugly documents, especially when every report comes out looking different from the last one. So I kept tweaking the typography, colors, and spacing until I had something I actually wanted to read.

Then I was invited to present a talk based on my article "The Agent You Don't Know: Principles, Architecture, and Engineering Practice" and needed a slide deck that matched the same standard. That round pushed the system further, adding inline SVG diagrams, a consistent warm palette, and tighter editorial rhythm. Eventually it was doing enough that I pulled it into its own package. That became kami: one visual language I like, applied to everything I ship.
